Analysing network data in R is quite convenient. Analysing *ego-centered* network data in R is much more complicated. With `egor` we are aiming to make the latter as easy as the first. Raw ego-centered network data comes in all kinds of formats, `egor` provides tools for importing most of these formats and making the data available for analysis in R using packages as `igraph` or `statnet`.

This introduction shows you how to

1. [Import](import.html)
2. Manipulate
3. Analyse and
4. Visualise

ego-centered networks in R with the help of `egor`.
