Ego-centererd network data includes three kinds of data:

1. Ego data
2. Alters data
3. Edge data

The inforamtion on the **egos** is usually stored in a dataset,
represented in R as a `dataframe`. With the exception of the ego data, there are
several formats the data can be stored in.

**Alters** data can be stored in a 
single `dataframe` with the alters as the rows (long-format), the data might be 
split up into seperate files for each ego/ network or it might be in the same 
dataset as the egos data, with the alters information in colums _or_ as 
variables (wide-format.)

Finally the **edges** can be stored as edgelists (in one or in seperate files), as
matrices or in colums of a `dataframe` (wide-format).

`egor` helps with the importing of all these formats into R, by 
providing seperate functions that are dedicated to handle each kind of format.
In addition there are three funtcions that let you import all of the data in one
line of code:

## Single Command Import
`egor` supports importing three different data formats with a single command.
These are:

- **One-File**: All the data is stored in one file; egos as rows; alters and edge data
in the wide-format.

- **Two-Files**: Ego data and edges (wide-format) are stored in one file and the
alters (long-format) in another.

- **Folders**: Egos in one file; folders of files per ego for alters and edges.

### One- & Two-File(s) Format

In order to import data stored in the One- or Two-File(s) format you need to 
load the datasets intro R first. If your data is stored as .csv-Files, use the
`read.csv()` or `read.csv2()` command.

**One-File:**


```{r, eval = TRUE}
setwd(system.file("extdata", package = "egor"))

egos_one <- read.csv2("one_file_8.csv")
```
    

**Two-Files:**
```{r}
setwd(system.file("extdata", package = "egor"))

egos_two <- read.csv2("two_files_8_egos.csv")

alters_two <- read.csv2("alters_8.csv")
```

    

    read.egonet.one.file(egos, netsize,  netID = "netID", attr.start.col, attr.end.col, dy.max.alters, dy.first.var)
    
    read.egonet.two.files(egos, long, netsize = NULL,  netID = "netID", alterID = NULL, dy.max.alters, dy.first.var)

    read.egonet.folders(egos, alter.folder, edge.folder, netID = "netID")
